Varun is bored, so he explored something in his phone, where he is having the old dialpad
phone, so when he looking that phone , he noticed that every number is associated with 
three english alphabets, so he wanted to know, if he presses any numbers how many combinations 
of the alphabets will occur, for better understanding,

Phone dialpad:

   1     2     3
   -    abc   def
  
   4     5     6
  ghi   jkl   mno
  
   7     8     9
  pqr   stu   wxyz
  
   *     0     #
   
   where the dail keys (1,*,0,#) is nnot associated with any other numbers, as well you see the number 9 is associated with 4 alphabets
   so if varun presses '45', then the letter combinations are, 'gj gk gl hj hk hl ij ik il'
   so create a algorithm to help varun.
